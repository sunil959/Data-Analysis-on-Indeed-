Strong background in computer science with good knowledge of data science.
You will be working on a very special project. We will provide you guidance and feedback continually. If we like your work, we will extend the internship or you can work time on it on a stipend basis.
The main objective of this project is to create a robust code that can do analysis automatically without any manual intervention to give out a close enough accuracy when compared to the accuracy one can get from manually doing the project.
You have to build the code in python to achieve the following -
1) Import Dataset: Classify variables into id, nominal, interval variables etc.
2) Data Cleaning: Imputation, normalization, handling outlier, spelling mistake, invalid input, handling date format, oversampling if needed etc.
3) Modeling: Build major models like regression, decision tree, gradient boosting, random forest, deep neural net, ensemble models, XGBoost etc. Also, you need to autotune hyperparameter or settings of models using K cross validation.
4) Comparison: select best model based on various matrix of misclassification, AUC, adjusted r square etc.
5) Scoring: score dataset with the best model
The code is needed to be very systematic and properly commented so that its very easy to build onto that code in the future.
In the end, you need to make a simple GUI with python code, asking to input the location of the datasets from user, and then running the above code in the background to provide the user with the scored dataset and the accuracy of the best model
If we like your work, we can continue you on a permanent basis on a stipend basis.

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

Two to three years of experience with Artificial Intelligence, Quantitative and Qualitative Analytics, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language processing and Unstructured data analytics

Insight Jedi is hiring a Machine Learning expert.
*
*
What do we do?
There are a lot of companies that do machine learning. Lots of companies also build tools to manage and deploy machine learning models. But most of the “learning” part of machine learning is still human driven. Once a problem is posed, everything -- data cleanup, feature engineering, model building -- is still mostly done manually by data scientists. There are no tools that help domain experts e.g. business users or analysts, to do all these things automatically -- one would still need to know enough coding and statistics to make them work.
We started thinking about this problem a few years back. A couple of years back we finally were able to build a platform that automates everything -- users just bring their data, answer a few questions, and get very accurate predictive models in minutes or hours, not weeks and months -- completely automatically! The platform doesn’t care where the data came from or how the data looks like.
Insight Jedi’s ability to build models completely automatically has enabled us to solve some of the toughest business problems -- across multiple domains. Our platform has been able to predict which cell phone towers are about to fail for a large European tele-communications company; it was able to measure the impact of delivery delays in logistics to buying patterns of customers from transactions for a well known e-commerce company -- connecting for the first time, the data in two silos; it has drastically improved collections for healthcare companies by model-driven prioritizations; it has automatically alerted of anomalous patterns from almost a million metrics being tracked by one of the largest global CPG companies, helping them address issues months before they would have identified.
**
How can we work together?
On any given day, we spend our time doing lots of things. If you join our team, you will be working with us on each of these. We have made a ton of progress building this platform from the ground-up, and have had actual impact on our client’s businesses. But there’s a lot to be done.
Large part of our job is to understand the scale of automation needed to convert a complex but pretty generic business problem to a collection of algorithms working in tandem. As an example, when we are automatically surfacing anomalies for hundreds of time-series metrics, we are not doing just that. We are automating extracting anomalies from any time series data, we are automating finding patterns in anomalies, and we are automating what to say about the future by looking at patterns in anomalies. You will be contributing in combining otherwise isolated algorithms to deliver automated solutions.
As an expert, you have read, implemented or devised lots of algorithms. But a lot of these algorithms never see real life since the path to automating it to a large number of real-world problems is not obvious. Our key premise -- that everything including feature engineering, model selection, model estimation will be automated -- and, our repeated interactions of real-life problems from our clients -- gives us an open playground to bring large scale adoption of all these algorithms. You will help in bringing these algorithms to “life”.
We design our own algorithms using any mathematical building blocks e.g. EM and variational methods, Bayesian models and appropriate priors, Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, regularisation, gradient descent, matrix factorisation, etc. We have a good understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory to understand academic research papers in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. It is expected that you have some formal training in this.
We code, write tests, tune for speed and memory consumption, and finally, document and deploy algorithms to production. We code in python (and Cython), but if you are proficient in at least one language, we are confident that you will be able to contribute to our production code.
We scale algorithms to large datasets in way shorter time by designing them from scratch. It might even mean certain tradeoffs and understanding of computing e.g. making use of embarrassingly parallel methods, map-reduce frameworks, or tricks of linear algebra, etc. Knowledge of algorithmic and computing fundamentals which allow scaling will be favorable.
Location:
We are OK with remote work, at least initially, although we expect familiarity with tools like github to make remote work more efficient.
What will you be working on?
Insight Jedi builds custom applications on the platform which solve some of the hardest business problems for our clients. Your responsibility will be to understand the business problem and use the platform components to automate the complete data science workflow for the problem. Our deliverable to our clients is an application which just ingests data and automatically builds models, throws insights as visualisations, and even auto-update the model when new data comes in. You will be responsible for everything in the backend that does this. This includes:
Framing the business problem as the most appropriate machine learning problem.
Incorporating platform components to build what we call a custom recipe. We have a well-maintained but complex and large code-base -- you will be understanding how each component is related with others. Custom recipes almost always have multiple sources of data coming in -- you will be structuring the data such that the automated feature engineering and filtering engines can take over (it is called the Signal Factory in Insight Jedi).
Building insights from the model and the data which answers all the big and small questions which define the business problem. Insights are typically outputs of predictive models, small standalone statistical models, or just data being shown in specific ways.
Contribute to developing core algorithms of the Insight Jedi platform.
Help the rest of the team to respond to customer requests for support, or questions on how things work and why.
What will you bring in?
You will have good knowledge of python.
You will have a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.
You will have strong communication skills to understand what needs to be done, ask questions to flesh out ideas, and even document work when needed.

About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.

There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

This is an in-office internship & will start in June. The need for translating domain specific content such as legal documents, technical and non-technical documents, educational materials, government procedures and services is increasing exponentially. Most of the tools manufactured by Russia are written in Russian. These need to be translated efficiently into English to be of benefit to the Indian Navy. This includes the automated translations for Standards (GOST), Operating Documents, Repair Technical Documents (RTD), Technical Drawings, Contracts, Supplementary Agreements (SAs), Price Catalogues, Speeches, Minutes of Meetings, etc. These documents are available in formats like Word, Excel, PDF, Power Point, Image etc. The translation process presently being undertaken by RTC is manual. Manual Translation of documents is evidently tedious and time intensive. Hence the goal is to build processes and models that would lead to enhanced translation tools enabling large-scale translation of domain specific content into English. We propose an online framework for translating Russian to English.

We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it.

So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take results-oriented steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take results-oriented steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take results-oriented steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company.
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company.
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company.
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Data Scientist,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",HP,None,Sponsored,"At CrowdStrike we’re on a mission - to stop breaches. Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.
Benefits of Working at CrowdStrike:
