This is a business process optimisation job where you are required to sit through annotated data and do curation of the annotated data. This is a manual data quality checking job.
Please apply if and only if,
you are detail oriented and enjoy data annotation and data quality processes,
you wish to take part in data annotation and data tagging work to tag objects from photos and videos,
you want to produce high quality annotated datasets (that can be used to build highly accurate Artificial Intelligence models/products),
you are keen to champion a team (assign tasks, explain the tasks, monitor the quality, review the work, do corrections by yourself) that works on data annotation and data curation tasks
you can speak English and Tamil fluently
Once you apply, we will share a small write-up assignment with you. Only those who pass the assignment submission will be considered for the subsequent phone/on-site interviews. This is our method to judge genuine candidates among the sea of enthusiast.
*About the job*:
Infilect works towards building artificial intelligent products. The core of artificial intelligence today is very well annotated datasets. As a lead data annotator, you will lead and work with a team of data annotators to annotate objects in photos and videos. Infilect works in retail domain and you will need to tag objects such as Pepsi/Coke bottles in photos and videos captured in retail stores. A typical day involves creating data annotation instruction manuals (how does a Pepsi bottle look vs how does a Coke bottle look), tracking quality of annotated data by monitoring the work of data annotation team, and doing corrections in order to produce high quality annotated data for the team that works on building artificial intelligence algorithms.
We are an early stage start-up (and not a late stage start-up such as Flipkart/Ola). This implies high risk high reward environment, doing grunt work at a few times, having ownership and responsibility, do everything that should be done to get the task done on time. The rewards are of course in terms of fulfilment (some philosophy here!), above market salary, rapid growth in compensation, and stock options.

you can speak English and Tamil fluently
Once you apply, we will share a small write-up assignment with you. Only those who pass the assignment submission will be considered for the subsequent phone/on-site interviews. This is our method to judge genuine candidates among the sea of enthusiast.

Please apply if and only if,
you are detail oriented and enjoy data annotation and data quality processes,

We are an early stage start-up (and not a late stage start-up such as Flipkart/Ola). This implies high risk high reward environment, doing grunt work at a few times, having ownership and responsibility, do everything that should be done to get the task done on time. The rewards are of course in terms of fulfilment (some philosophy here!), above market salary, rapid growth in compensation, and stock options.

We asked our people what they love about working with Consilium Software. They said they liked working for a company that is big enough to be a force on the global stage, yet small enough for one person to make a difference. You are not just a number or a name on an org chart. We feel every employee can make a difference and be part of collaborating to build products that are trusted by Fortune-list customers and governments. That’s what we are always trying to deliver as a culture for the team. Having the ability to make a visible difference comes with a high level of responsibility, and we understand that not everyone gets excited about that. In our interviews we make sure you find out what we are and what we are not, to ensure that Consilium is just as good a fit for you, as you are for Consilium!

Product Manager,"Gurgaon, Haryana",Netomi,None,Organic,"At Ajira AI, we focus on developing smart products that leverage artificial intelligence algorithms. We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers ecosystems to help people.
We’re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We’re a close knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful start-ups. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we’re now looking to add experienced Data Science Developers to our team in Pune.
You have hands-on experience using AI frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras in a work setting. You have at least a couple of years of work experience using Python/R. You’ve used multiple classification models and Pandas, Numpy, Matlab etc. You are proficient at using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes etc. You have a track record of demonstrated success in business problem solving. Data visualization experience is a plus.
You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what’s happening in the data science world and know the differences between classification, regression, clustering and time series. You know the limitations of each algorithm. You are motivated to learn new technologies.
That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:
Who we are:
We are an Insurtech company with a core mission of leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.
We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.
Who you’ll be working with:
We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, our software lab is located in Pune, India. We have decades of experience working with remote teams. We’re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.
You’ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he’s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You’ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.
Your work environment:
We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and through we are a start-up, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.
We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.
Our Pune office space is modest. We prefer to pay you more than prevailing market wages rather than spend money on fancy office space.
Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.
We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.
Your skills:
You keep up with technology changes and trends
You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them
You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs
You are skilled at development with Python/R and using Ai frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras
Proficient in the use of Pandas, Numpy, Matlib, MatPlotlib and commonly used libraries
You understand ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, XgBoost etc thoroughly
You are quick to understand business problems and understand how to classify problems that exist in large datasets
Any data visualization experience is a plus as is any background in statistics
You have developed, implemented and supported a ML application successfully at work

Data Scientist,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Zauba Corp,None,Organic,"About Tookitaki

Tookitaki is providing machine learning-powered enterprise solutions to address regulatory compliance problems in the financial services sector. Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:

We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)
We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)
We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)
We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)

In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs.

Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.

Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS.

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

You will collaborate with other scientists and work in a fast paced team environment. Your work will directly impact our customer shopping experience, save millions in concessions. You will constantly stretch the boundaries of Machine Learning to tackle business challenges.
If you are customer obsessed, self-driven, tenacious and analytical, you will have fun solving our business problems of unprecedented scale. As an experienced machine learning scientist, you will help research and develop new computer algorithms leveraging both classical and deep learning techniques.
