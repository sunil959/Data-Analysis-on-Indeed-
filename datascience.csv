Machine learning expert,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Insight Jedi,,Organic,"Position: Machine learning expert
Designation : Junior data scientist
Qualification : No specific requirements.
Experience : Minimum 2 years of experience as hands-on data scientist
*
Insight Jedi is hiring a Machine Learning expert.
*
*
What do we do?
There are a lot of companies that do machine learning. Lots of companies also build tools to manage and deploy machine learning models. But most of the “learning” part of machine learning is still human driven. Once a problem is posed, everything -- data cleanup, feature engineering, model building -- is still mostly done manually by data scientists. There are no tools that help domain experts e.g. business users or analysts, to do all these things automatically -- one would still need to know enough coding and statistics to make them work.
We started thinking about this problem a few years back. A couple of years back we finally were able to build a platform that automates everything -- users just bring their data, answer a few questions, and get very accurate predictive models in minutes or hours, not weeks and months -- completely automatically! The platform doesn’t care where the data came from or how the data looks like.
Insight Jedi’s ability to build models completely automatically has enabled us to solve some of the toughest business problems -- across multiple domains. Our platform has been able to predict which cell phone towers are about to fail for a large European tele-communications company; it was able to measure the impact of delivery delays in logistics to buying patterns of customers from transactions for a well known e-commerce company -- connecting for the first time, the data in two silos; it has drastically improved collections for healthcare companies by model-driven prioritizations; it has automatically alerted of anomalous patterns from almost a million metrics being tracked by one of the largest global CPG companies, helping them address issues months before they would have identified.
**
How can we work together?
On any given day, we spend our time doing lots of things. If you join our team, you will be working with us on each of these. We have made a ton of progress building this platform from the ground-up, and have had actual impact on our client’s businesses. But there’s a lot to be done.
Large part of our job is to understand the scale of automation needed to convert a complex but pretty generic business problem to a collection of algorithms working in tandem. As an example, when we are automatically surfacing anomalies for hundreds of time-series metrics, we are not doing just that. We are automating extracting anomalies from any time series data, we are automating finding patterns in anomalies, and we are automating what to say about the future by looking at patterns in anomalies. You will be contributing in combining otherwise isolated algorithms to deliver automated solutions.
As an expert, you have read, implemented or devised lots of algorithms. But a lot of these algorithms never see real life since the path to automating it to a large number of real-world problems is not obvious. Our key premise -- that everything including feature engineering, model selection, model estimation will be automated -- and, our repeated interactions of real-life problems from our clients -- gives us an open playground to bring large scale adoption of all these algorithms. You will help in bringing these algorithms to “life”.
We design our own algorithms using any mathematical building blocks e.g. EM and variational methods, Bayesian models and appropriate priors, Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, regularisation, gradient descent, matrix factorisation, etc. We have a good understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory to understand academic research papers in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. It is expected that you have some formal training in this.
We code, write tests, tune for speed and memory consumption, and finally, document and deploy algorithms to production. We code in python (and Cython), but if you are proficient in at least one language, we are confident that you will be able to contribute to our production code.
We scale algorithms to large datasets in way shorter time by designing them from scratch. It might even mean certain tradeoffs and understanding of computing e.g. making use of embarrassingly parallel methods, map-reduce frameworks, or tricks of linear algebra, etc. Knowledge of algorithmic and computing fundamentals which allow scaling will be favorable.
Location:
We are OK with remote work, at least initially, although we expect familiarity with tools like github to make remote work more efficient.
What will you be working on?
Insight Jedi builds custom applications on the platform which solve some of the hardest business problems for our clients. Your responsibility will be to understand the business problem and use the platform components to automate the complete data science workflow for the problem. Our deliverable to our clients is an application which just ingests data and automatically builds models, throws insights as visualisations, and even auto-update the model when new data comes in. You will be responsible for everything in the backend that does this. This includes:
Framing the business problem as the most appropriate machine learning problem.
Incorporating platform components to build what we call a custom recipe. We have a well-maintained but complex and large code-base -- you will be understanding how each component is related with others. Custom recipes almost always have multiple sources of data coming in -- you will be structuring the data such that the automated feature engineering and filtering engines can take over (it is called the Signal Factory in Insight Jedi).
Building insights from the model and the data which answers all the big and small questions which define the business problem. Insights are typically outputs of predictive models, small standalone statistical models, or just data being shown in specific ways.
Contribute to developing core algorithms of the Insight Jedi platform.
Help the rest of the team to respond to customer requests for support, or questions on how things work and why.
What will you bring in?
You will have good knowledge of python.
You will have a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.
You will have strong communication skills to understand what needs to be done, ask questions to flesh out ideas, and even document work when needed.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take results-oriented steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.
Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.
Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.
Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.
Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that ""science"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist — just as any good statistician or other analytics professional — must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.
Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.
Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organization’s business processes.
Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise. Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology applications. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with business needs.
Data Analysis: Sets standards for advanced analytics tool usage and techniques, advises on their application, and ensures compliance. Manages the investigation of corporate data requirements, and co-ordinates the application of data analysis and analytics techniques, based upon a detailed understanding of the corporate information requirements, in order to establish, modify or maintain analytical models and their associated components.
Autonomy: Has authority and responsibility for all aspects of data science, including policy formation and application. Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.
Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations. Develops long-term strategic relationships with customers, partners, industry leaders and government.
Complexity: Performs highly complex work activities covering technical, financial and quality aspects. Contributes to the formulation and implementation of IT strategy. Creatively applies a wide range of technical and/or management principles.
Business Skills Absorbs complex technical information and communicates effectively at all levels to both technical and non-technical audiences. Assesses and evaluates risk. Understands the implications of new technologies. Demonstrates clear leadership and the ability to influence and persuade. Has a broad understanding of all aspects of IT and deep understanding of own specialism(s). Understands and communicates the role and impact of IT in the employing organization and promotes compliance with relevant legislation. Takes the initiative to keep both own and subordinates' skills up to date and to maintain an awareness of developments in the IT industry.

Broad range of business and IT experiences; Has achieved technical and/or business certification(s).
Skills/Competencies:
Communication: Data scientists must communicate effectively up and down the data supply chain: first, to obtain access to the data they require; second, to work with those who understand the business meaning behind the data; and third, to articulate findings and implications to business leaders in language they understand. A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.
Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.
Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.
Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.
Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that ""science"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist — just as any good statistician or other analytics professional — must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.
Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.
Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organization’s business processes.
Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise. Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology applications. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with business needs.
Data Analysis: Sets standards for advanced analytics tool usage and techniques, advises on their application, and ensures compliance. Manages the investigation of corporate data requirements, and co-ordinates the application of data analysis and analytics techniques, based upon a detailed understanding of the corporate information requirements, in order to establish, modify or maintain analytical models and their associated components.
Autonomy: Has authority and responsibility for all aspects of data science, including policy formation and application. Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.
Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations. Develops long-term strategic relationships with customers, partners, industry leaders and government.
Complexity: Performs highly complex work activities covering technical, financial and quality aspects. Contributes to the formulation and implementation of IT strategy. Creatively applies a wide range of technical and/or management principles.
Business Skills Absorbs complex technical information and communicates effectively at all levels to both technical and non-technical audiences. Assesses and evaluates risk. Understands the implications of new technologies. Demonstrates clear leadership and the ability to influence and persuade. Has a broad understanding of all aspects of IT and deep understanding of own specialism(s). Understands and communicates the role and impact of IT in the employing organization and promotes compliance with relevant legislation. Takes the initiative to keep both own and subordinates' skills up to date and to maintain an awareness of developments in the IT industry.

a combination of econometrics and machine-learning.

Experience maintaining a horizontally scalable data warehouse at at-least a Terabyte scale, and enforcing correctness between multiple systems

Proven leadership ability as the technology lead for teams of 3-5 developers. Experience with offshore / remote teams preferred.
A desire to work in a collaborative environment focusing on continuous learning; participating in tech talks, code review, and some pair programming.
